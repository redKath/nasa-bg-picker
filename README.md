# NASA View Picker

This is one of my first projects I did when starting to learn JavaScript with [#100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/), an online, free, 30 week bootcamp, meant to bring you from zero programming skills to employable taught by [Leon Noel](https://twitter.com/leonnoel).

## Overview
The project is to build out this view picker that uses images from the James Webb Space Telescope.

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned about DOM rendering manipulation using JavaScript and how to layer multiple images in one HTML element. 

The key building block of this project is layering multiple images in CSS:

```css
.layered-bg {
 background-image: url(), url()
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I'll publish a live site for this and make it responsive for mobile phones and other screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Multiple Backgrounds in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Using_multiple_backgrounds) - This helped me for layering the vector image of the cockpit of the spaceship and the background image from James Webb Space Telescope.

Thank you to fellow [#100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) folks, [Cal](https://github.com/CalArcher/), for helping me to figure out what keyword to search to solve my problem on layering multiple images in CSS, since it took me a while to find the solution. ðŸ˜‚
